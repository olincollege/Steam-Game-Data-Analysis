# Steam Game Data Analysis

This is a repository for a Python project analyzing what makes a popular 
game on the platform Steam. 

## Summary

In this project, we gathered data from Steam using the requests library. We then
analyzed many different aspects of this data, including price, genre and tags, 
average reviews, and the number of people who have left reviews.

## Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file is blank and should be filled out with any project
dependencies. There is a Python package called `pipreqs` that autogenerates the
contents of the `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your
`.py` files. To get this, run

```
pip install pipreqs
```

Then, in the root of your project repository, run:

```
pipreqs --mode compat
```

If you already have a `requirements.txt`, the above command will ask you to
rerun the command with the `--force` flag to overwrite it.
